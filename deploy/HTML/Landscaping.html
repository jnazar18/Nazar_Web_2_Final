        <h2 class="h2">Lawn Aeration</h2>
        <p>Aerating the soil to allow air, water and nutrients to penetrate the roots of your lawn’s grass can greatly improve the quality of your soil compaction as well as the length and strength of your grass. If your lawn is ailing, you’ll want to try aeration. Core aerification helps rejuvenate your lawn by removing small bits of thatch and soil to promote greater pore space for air and water movement and root growth. Get a free quote today!</p>
